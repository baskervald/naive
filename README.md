Naive
---
Naive is a scripting language I'm creating mostly for file i/o, although it'll be expanded in the future

Check design/ for my design specs

It's going to compile to bytecode, which'll then be ran in a C VM

First bytecode compiler will be written in python, then it will be ported to C and Naive itself
